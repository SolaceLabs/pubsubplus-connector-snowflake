[preface]
== Preface

{overview}

== Getting Started

Assuming you're using the default `application.yml` within this package, following one of the below quick start guides will result in a connector that will connect to the PubSub+ broker and {vendor-system-name} using default credentials, with 2 workflows enabled, workflow 0 and workflow 1. Where:

* Workflow 0 is consuming messages from the Solace PubSub+ queue, `Solace/Queue/0`, and publishing them to the {vendor-system-name} producer destination, `producer-destination`.
* Workflow 1 is consuming messages from the {vendor-system-name} consumer destination, `consumer-destination`, and publishing them to the Solace PubSub+ topic, `Solace/Topic/1`.

A workflow is the configuration of a flow of messages from a source to a target. The connector supports up to 20 concurrent workflows per instance.

NOTE: The connector will not provision queues which do not exist.

=== Prerequisites

* https://solace.com/products/event-broker/[Solace PubSub+ Event Broker]
* {vendor-system-name}

=== Quick Start common steps

These are the steps that are required to run all quick-start examples:

ifdef::connector-requires-external-libs[]
. Create a directory called `libs` in the same directory as the jar file.
.. For more info about this directory, see <<Adding External Libraries>>.
.. This directory may already exist
. Download the jars for the {vendor-system-name} and all its dependencies to the `libs` directory:
endif::[]
. Update the provided `samples/config/application.yml` with the values for your deployment.
